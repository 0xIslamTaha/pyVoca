If a child screams in a library, it's not that unusual, but if an adult does, that's an incident! As an adjective, incident is used in the field of physics to describe particles or radiation that fall on a surface. The incident light showed how dirty the windows were.", 'short': 'An incident refers to a particular happening, sometimes criminal but always noteworthy.

More figurative types of chains include things that hold you back, like the chains of your responsibility to your family, or connected occurrences â\x80\x94 like a chain of events that leads to you meeting your best friend.', 'short': "A chain is a long series of connected metal links. Chains are strong and flexible, so they're useful for pulling a heavy load or securing a dangerous animal."}, 'pursuit': {'long': "Whether it's a police officer in a car chase or a student working towards a college degree at a university in the tropics, both can be considered in “hot pursuit.”\xa0 Derived from the Anglo-French purseute, pursuit means the act of pursuing or striving towards goals. In the late 14th century it implied persecution, but things have changed since then.", 'short': "A pursuit is a chase or or a quest for something. When a guard runs after an escaping jewel thief, she's in pursuit — while the thief may have stolen the jewels because he was in pursuit of wealth."}, 'quarrel': {'long': 'You’re probably familiar with the verb, quarrel, meaning having a disagreement.  When there’s a quarrel, there’s anger. As a noun, quarrel, refers to the square-headed arrow shot from crossbow. This meaning of the word comes from the Old French quarel, relating to "square.” If you are quarreling, just don\'t reach for your crossbow and quarrel.', 'short': 'To quarrel is to fight — but usually not physically. Quarreling is a fact of life, occurring between the best of friends, in the happiest of marriages, and between parents and their children.'}, 'buoyant': {'long': 'Someone with a buoyant personality is fun to be around, laughs a lot, smiles, and cheers other people up. Buoyant people are lively and lighthearted â\x80\x94 the opposite of sad, depressed, and bummed out. Buoyant people are also called bubbly and cheerful, and it should help to remember that buoyant objects float â\x80\x94 just like a buoyant person can seem like they\'re floating too (as in the expression "floating on air").', 'short': 'Something that is buoyant floats in water. Since floating is happier than sinking, buoyant also refers to things are fun and upbeat.'}, 'picky': {'long': "When you invite your picky friend to dinner, you'll probably have a hard time deciding what to serve, since she hates all vegetables; and if you're picky about sleeping in a comfortable, clean place, you might not be a fan of camping. Picky people are hard to please â\x80\x94 they like things to be a certain way. This informal word first appeared in the 1860s.", 'short': "If you're extremely particular or fussy, you're picky. A picky eater might only eat chicken nuggets and tater tots."}, 'doubt': {'long': 'When you\'re in doubt, you really can\'t tell what\'s true and what\'s false, whether that\'s a news story or whether you want to marry someone or whether you\'ll survive Med school. The Latin root of doubt is dubitÄ\x81re, "to hesitate, waver," and when you doubt something you\'re wavering: I think I believe you, but maybe I don\'t. But maybe I do. But maybe not? One thing not to doubt is the silent b. Pronounce: DOWT.', 'short': 'Doubt is distrust or suspicion. When your kid sister explains that a robber broke in and ate your entire chocolate stash, most likely you feel doubt.'}, 'exhaustive': {'long': "When you are exhaustive about something, you are testing all possibilities or considering all elements.

When you recruit a new employee (or spouse), you undertake an exhaustive search for the best talent.'}, 'postponing': {'long': 'Anything you\'re putting for is being postponed: people postpone things they don\'t have time to do or just don\'t want to do. Since doctor and dental appointments are no fun, people postpone them a lot. You can postpone small things, like going to the store or watching a video. The government can postpone big things, like the passing of bills or the invasion of another country. People who procrastinate are constantly postponing. When you see the word postpone, think "Later!"', 'short': 'To postpone something is to put it off until later. You can postpone an appointment today and reschedule it for tomorrow.'}, 'disrupt': {'long': 'Disrupt goes back to the Latin root disrumpere, "to break apart." When you disrupt, you break someone\'s concentration, break up a routine, or break apart a system or order, as when bad weather disrupts the travel plans of people in airports. Even if your headphones keep the music in your ears only, singing out loud can disrupt those around you. A larger interruption would be if a war were to erupt. That would disrupt the peace of an entire region and its people.', 'short': "To disrupt is to interrupt or throw something into disorder. If you don't turn your phone off before a play, it might ring and disrupt the actors and the audience."}, 'cope': {'long': 'From the Old French couper, cope means “come to blows with." Coping can imply struggle, but it’s usually met with success or at the very least, not failure.

If you can cope with the stress, you will be excellent at defusing bombs."}, 'settle': {'long': 'Settle has a number of meanings. After moving several times, you\'ll wish your parents would settle in one place for the rest of your school years. Have you ever heard your house creaking or groaning? That\'s the house settling. When adults tell children to calm down, they\'ll often say, "Settle down kids!"

An audience often grows restless when they're waiting for the second act of a play to start and there's an unexpected delay."}, 'awful': {'long': 'In addition to meaning exceptionally bad, the adjective awful can also mean exceedingly large or extreme in degree.

As in, "It\'s taking you an awful long time to finish that paper. Stop procrastinating."', 'short': "Describe something that is exceptionally bad as awful, but be careful: Saying your mom's cooking is awful may be truthful, but it's also likely to get you a frying pan upside the head."}, 'reasonable': {'long': "If you're reasonable, you have good sense and judgment. A reasonable decision is rational and thought out, like your mom's reasonable rule about not eating crumbly foods in her car. When you describe a store's prices as reasonable, you mean they're fair — not too high. And if you are given a reasonable amount of time to do a project for school, you have no excuse for it being late.", 'short': "Reasonable describes someone or something that's sensible and fair, like your teacher who gives reasonable homework assignments — they don't take you forever to do and they relate to what you are studying."}, 'tend': {'long': 'You can also say you tend something if you care for it. You have to tend a vegetable garden, for example, if you expect to harvest more vegetables than weeds. If you are inclined to do something, then you tend to do that thing.

If you tend the bar in a restaurant, for example, you serve drinks, dry glasses, and fill dishes with pretzels.'}, 'numerous': {'long': 'The adjective numerous is related to the word number — which is no big surprise since it basically means "a large number of something." Use numerous to describe a copious or abundant amount that you can\'t give a specific number for. Numerous fans probably come out for the all-star game, for example. And numerous players wish they made the all-star team.', 'short': 'Numerous means very large in quantity. You wouldn’t use numerous to describe how many feet you have (just two), but you could use it to describe the infinite number of shoes in your closet.'}, 'chase': {'long': 'The word chase tried to run away from the Old French word chacier for "to hunt or strive for,” but we caught it. Any time you’re trying to get something that’s trying to get away from you, you chase it. Police officers chase criminals, and kids playing tag chase each other all over the yard. You can also chase things that aren\'t physical, like a dream or a goal. This activity itself is called a chase.', 'short': 'To chase is to follow or go after someone or something you want. This activity is called a chase. Dogs chase cats, cats chase mice, and mice are in big trouble.'}, 'thoughtful': {'long': "The adjective thoughtful describes someone who pays attention or considers others' feelings when they speak and act.

Thoughtful can also describe intellectual depth, like a thoughtful essay on a well-known poem that focuses on a line that other scholars have overlooked.", 'short': "You are thoughtful if you consider how your actions and words will affect other people’s feelings. It is thoughtful to cook your friend's favorite dish when you invite him over for dinner."}, 'introvert': {'long': 'Introvert comes from Latin intro-, "inward," and vertere, "turning."  It describes a person who tends to turn inward mentally. Introverts sometimes avoid large groups of people, feeling more energized by time alone. The opposite of an introvert is an extrovert, who finds energy in interactions with others. Introvert can also be a verb, meaning literally to "fold inward," or to "turn inward," as when a child\'s personality seems to introvert once she starts elementary school.', 'short': 'An introvert generally prefers solitary activities to interacting with large groups of people. If you would rather work through your feelings in your diary than have a conversation, then you are an introvert.'}, 'contrasts': {'long': 'You probably know contrast in its relation to compare. To contrast something is to look for differences among two or more elements, but compare is to do the opposite, to look for similarities. It\'s easy to tell the difference if you remember that contrast comes from the Latin root contra, and means "against." Contrast is also a noun meaning basically the same thing â\x80\x94 you might notice the contrast of a dark tree against a snow-covered hill.', 'short': 'The verb contrast means to show a difference, like photos that reveal how much weight someone lost by contrasting the "before" and "after" shots.'}, 'proposed': {'long': 'The word propose comes from the Old French root words pro, meaning "forth" and poser, meaning "put, place."
